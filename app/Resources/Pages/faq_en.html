                    <h4><span>Who made the clothes ?</span></h4>
                    <p>
Every piece of Gros Gary Collection is made by one person only. I design, handprint, embroider and make all clothing and accessories of the collection. My workshop is based in Toulouse, France.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>Where do the fabrics come from ?</span></h4>
                    <p>
I have two suppliers for now :<br/>
- Biotissus, a french company based in Brittany. <br/>
- Lebenskleidung, a german company.<br/>
These two compagnies offer a choice of organic cotton fabrics (GOTS certified), cultivated and waved in Turkey.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>What does GOTS certified mean ?</span></h4>
                    <p>
GOTS is short for Global Organic Textile Standard.This label guarantees environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing of textiles throughout every step of the production.

                    </p>
                    <h4><span>What does OekoTex Standard 100 mean ?</span></h4>
                    <p>
The inks used to print the fabric respect the OekoTex Standard 100. This label guarantees the absence of toxic substances, making them safe for both men and environment. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>How to choose my size correctly ? / What does the personnalised size option mean ?</span></h4>
                    <p>
When ordering a t-shirt or a sweater, size options go from XXS to 5XL. The size chart will guide you in your choice.
If your measurements are not present or if you need an adjustment, you can select the personnalised size option. You will just have to join a message to your order to specify the needed adjustements or your measurements. You will find all the information you need to follow this process correctly on the page of each product. If doubts remain, feel free to contact me !
Please note that the personalised option is there to offer the best fit and not to change the design of the clothing.

                    <h4><span>How to take my measurements ?</span></h4>

You will find the proper procedure on each product page.  
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>Can I order a complete customized piece of clothing ?</span></h4>
                    <p>
Sure ! You just need to contact me by mail to explain your project. I will try to create it for you to the best of my abilities.
