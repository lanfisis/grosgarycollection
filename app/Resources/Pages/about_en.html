                        Gros Gary Collection is born from the wish to create a different brand.</br>
                        An inclusive brand for which all types of bodies and shapes matter.</br>
                        An ethical brand not only offering the basics.</br>
                        A brand based on a crafts(wo)manship allowing the creation of durable clothing for all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gros Gary Collection is therefore my way to be an ally to two fights.</br>
                        A fight for a fashion industry which includes and represents all women.</br>
                        A fight for a fashion industry that produces responsably on both social and ecological levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each piece of clothing is available in sizes going from XXS to 5XL. A personnalised option is offered for any needed adjustements or if you feel left out from our size chart.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Raw materials are carefully selected to offer both quality and lowest environmental impact. The cotton is organic and GOTS certified. The ink is free of any harmful substances (Oeko-Tex Standard 100). The leather is vegan. Small supplies are thrifted as much as possible.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The collection is entirely handmade in a workshop in Toulouse, France. Each step of the making process is carefully executed to deliver clothes that fit you the best and that you can keep for a long time !                    </p>
